Description: Many existing transfer learning methods rely on leveraging information from source data
  that closely resembles the target data. However, this approach often overlooks valuable knowledge that
  may be present in different yet potentially related auxiliary samples. When dealing with a limited amount
  of target data and a diverse range of source models, our paper introduces a novel approach, 
  Guided Adversarial Robust Transfer (GART) Learning, that breaks free from strict similarity constraints. 
  GART is designed to optimize the most adversarial loss within an uncertainty set, defined as a collection of target
  populations generated as a convex combination of source distributions that guarantee ex-
  cellent prediction performances for the target data. GART effectively bridges the realms of
  transfer learning and distributional robustness prediction models. We establish the iden-
  tifiability of GART and its interpretation as a weighted average of source models closest
  to the baseline model. We also show that GART achieves a faster convergence rate than
  the model fitted with the target data.
